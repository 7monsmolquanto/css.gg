Natrinai is one of the eight anthologies of classical Tamil poetry, also known as Ettuthokai. It contains 400 poems on various aspects of love and life, composed by different poets who lived between the 3rd century BCE and 3rd century CE. The poems are divided into two main categories: akam (love) and puram (heroic). Akam poems deal with the emotions and experiences of lovers in different landscapes, such as mountains, forests, deserts, and seashores. Puram poems describe the valor, generosity, and virtues of kings and warriors.

One of the most distinctive features of Natrinai is the use of thinai, or ecological zones, to classify the poems. There are five thinai: kurinji (mountainous region), mullai (forest region), marutham (agricultural region), neithal (coastal region), and palai (desert region). Each thinai has its own flora, fauna, climate, landscape, and lifestyle. The poets use these elements to create vivid descriptions and metaphors for the lovers and their situations. For example, in kurinji thinai, the lovers are often compared to wild animals, such as tigers, elephants, or peacocks. The love is passionate and adventurous, but also secretive and risky. In neithal thinai, the lovers are often compared to marine creatures, such as fish, turtles, or pearls. The love is sweet and tender, but also sorrowful and longing.
 
Another notable feature of Natrinai is the use of sangam, or conventions, to convey the emotions and messages of the poems. There are many sangam that the poets follow, such as using certain words, symbols, images, or scenarios to represent certain meanings. For example, one of the common sangam is the use of flowers to indicate the stages of love. The kurunji flower signifies the first meeting of the lovers, the mullai flower signifies their union, the marutham flower signifies their separation due to external reasons, the neithal flower signifies their reunion after a long wait, and the palai flower signifies their separation due to betrayal or death. Another common sangam is the use of seasons to indicate the mood of the poems. The spring season signifies joy and happiness, the summer season signifies anger and frustration, the rainy season signifies hope and expectation, the autumn season signifies sadness and despair, and the winter season signifies calmness and peace.
 
Natrinai is a masterpiece of Tamil literature that showcases the skill and creativity of the ancient poets. It is a collection of poems that capture the essence and diversity of human love and life in different contexts and settings. It is a work that inspires and enlightens anyone who reads it.
