## Step 1: Buy the NAVTEQ Europe map update
 
The first step is to buy the NAVTEQ Europe map update for your Opel Navi 900 SD card. You can do this online at the official Opel Navigation Store[^6^], where you can find the latest offers and discounts. The update costs $138.47 incl. VAT, excluding shipping[^4^]. You will receive a new SD card with the updated map data, which you will need to insert into your navigation system.
 
## Step 2: Backup your old SD card
 
Before you replace your old SD card with the new one, it is recommended that you backup your old SD card in case you need to restore it later. To do this, you will need a computer with an SD card reader and a software that can copy the contents of your SD card. You can use any software that you are familiar with, such as Windows Explorer or Mac Finder. Simply insert your old SD card into your computer and copy all the files and folders to a safe location on your hard drive.
 
## Step 3: Insert the new SD card into your navigation system
 
Once you have backed up your old SD card, you can insert the new SD card into your navigation system. To do this, you will need to locate the SD card slot on your dashboard or glove box. Make sure that your vehicle is parked and that the ignition is switched off. Then, gently push the old SD card to eject it from the slot and remove it. Next, insert the new SD card into the slot until it clicks into place. Do not force the SD card or bend it.
 
## Step 4: Enjoy your updated maps
 
After you have inserted the new SD card into your navigation system, you can switch on the ignition and start your vehicle. Your navigation system will automatically recognize the new SD card and load the updated maps. You can now enjoy your updated maps with more accurate and up-to-date information on roads, points of interest, speed limits, environmental zones, fuel types, and more[^4^]. You can also check the map version on your navigation system by going to Settings > System Information > Map Version.
