The movie Queen Of The Damned is based on the third novel of Anne Rice's The Vampire Chronicles series, but it also incorporates elements from the second novel, The Vampire Lestat. The movie was released in 2002 and directed by Michael Rymer, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Scott Abbott and Michael Petroni. The movie stars Stuart Townsend as Lestat, Aaliyah as Akasha, Marguerite Moreau as Jesse, Vincent Perez as Marius, and Lena Olin as Maharet.
 
The movie follows Lestat's rise to fame as a rock star and his awakening of Akasha, the ancient and powerful queen of all vampires. Akasha wants to make Lestat her king and destroy all other vampires who oppose her. Meanwhile, Jesse, a researcher for a paranormal organization called Talamasca, becomes fascinated by Lestat and his connection to her ancestor Maharet, one of the oldest vampires in existence. Jesse joins forces with Marius, Lestat's maker, and other vampires to stop Akasha from unleashing her wrath on the world.
 
The movie was dedicated to Aaliyah, who died in a plane crash shortly after completing her scenes. She received positive reviews for her performance as Akasha, but the movie itself was met with mostly negative criticism from fans and critics alike. The movie was criticized for deviating from the books, simplifying the characters and plot, and having poor special effects. The movie was also a box office flop, grossing only $45.4 million worldwide against a $35 million budget.
  
One of the most distinctive aspects of the movie Queen Of The Damned is its soundtrack, which features original songs written by Jonathan Davis of Korn and Richard Gibbs, a composer and former member of Oingo Boingo. The songs were performed by different metal vocalists, such as Marilyn Manson, Chester Bennington of Linkin Park, David Draiman of Disturbed, Wayne Static of Static-X, and Jay Gordon of Orgy. The songs were meant to represent Lestat's music as a rock star and his influence on the vampire world.
