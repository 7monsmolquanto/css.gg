# How to Enhance Your Artlantis Studio Projects with Shaders Pack and Models Pack
 
Artlantis Studio is a powerful 3D rendering software that allows you to create stunning visualizations of your architectural and design projects. But did you know that you can also customize and enrich your scenes with amazing shaders and models?
 
Shaders are materials that define the appearance and behavior of surfaces in your scene, such as color, texture, reflection, transparency, and more. Models are 3D objects that you can add to your scene, such as furniture, plants, vehicles, people, and more.
