That's why you need FHC Canute Software, a hydraulic calculation and analysis software for fire sprinkler systems, water mist systems, water spray systems, hydrants, and water cannons. FHC Canute Software is a trusted and tested software that has been used by hundreds of companies worldwide for over 15 years.
 
## What is FHC Canute Software?
 
FHC Canute Software is a software that allows you to build, calculate, and optimize any type of water-based fire protection system. You can use FHC Canute Software to design systems according to international standards, such as EN 12845, BS 9251, EN 16925, EN 14972-1, FM Global, NFPA 13, NFPA 750, and LPCB / BRE regulations[^1^].
 
FHC Canute Software has a user-friendly interface that lets you draw the hydraulic model of the system on your computer. You can instantly see the pipe network updating as you connect the pipes, and FHC Canute Software will automatically find any tees and elbows and look up the equivalent length in its extensive tube and fitting database. This will save you considerable time and reduce input errors.
 
FHC Canute Software also has a fast calculation algorithm that will give you the results you need in seconds. You can choose to use Hazen-Williams or Darcy-Weisbach pressure loss equations to calculate the pipe friction loss. You can also specify a fire pump curve, constant pressure pump, or a city water supply, and FHC Canute Software will balance the system to the water supply.
 
## What are the benefits of using FHC Canute Software?
 
By using FHC Canute Software, you can enjoy the following benefits:
 
- Save design time and installation costs by optimizing your system for the most economical design.
- Ensure compliance with international standards and regulations for fire protection systems.
