ACD/ChemSketch is a software application that allows users to draw chemical structures, molecules, reactions, schema, and biomolecules with ease and accuracy. It is one of the most popular and widely used chemical drawing software in the world, with over 2 million downloads[^1^] [^2^]. ChemSketch can also calculate molecular properties, generate IUPAC names, and create professional reports and presentations.
 
In this article, we will introduce some of the main features and benefits of ChemSketch, and show you how to use it for your academic or personal purposes.

## Features and Benefits of ChemSketch
 
ChemSketch is a comprehensive and versatile structure drawing software that can handle various types of chemical entities, such as organic molecules, organometallics, polymers, Lewis structures, 2D and 3D structure representations, delocalized Markush structures, and more[^2^]. It also supports drawing peptide sequences and complex schema, such as biotransformation maps[^2^].

Some of the advantages of using ChemSketch are:
 
- Easy to use: ChemSketch has a user-friendly interface and convenient tools that allow you to draw structures quickly and easily. You can draw molecules by clicking and dragging in the structure window, edit bonds or atoms with a few clicks, clean up your structure or rotate it to see different views, and more[^2^].
- Comprehensive structure editor: ChemSketch allows you to modify your structures in various ways, such as adding stereochemistry, charges, radicals, isotopes, abbreviations, labels, etc. You can also copy and paste structures from other applications or import them from various file formats[^2^].
- High quality output: ChemSketch can generate high-resolution images of your structures in various formats, such as BMP, PNG, JPEG, TIFF, etc. You can also export your structures as vector graphics (WMF or EMF) or as OLE objects that can be embedded in other documents[^2^].
- Affordable: ChemSketch is offered at no cost to academic institutions or for personal use for your at-home studies[^1^]. If you work for a commercial organization, you can purchase the full version of ChemSketch here[^1^].

## How to Use ChemSketch
 
To use ChemSketch for your academic or personal purposes, you need to download the freeware version from the ACD/Labs website[^1^]. The freeware version is developed exclusively for Windows 64-bit operating systems. If you use a Mac, you can learn how to configure a virtual machine to use ChemSketch on your computer here[^1^].
 
After installing ChemSketch on your computer, you can start drawing structures by following these steps:

1. Open ChemSketch and click on the Structure window.
2. Draw a molecule with C-C bonds by clicking and dragging in the Structure window.
3. Edit bonds or atoms with convenient tools on the toolbar or the right-click menu. For example, you can change bond types or angles, add or delete atoms or groups, change atom labels or properties, etc.
4. Clean up your structure by clicking on the Clean button on the toolbar. This will optimize the layout of your structure and remove any overlapping atoms or bonds.
5. View your structure in 2D or 3D by clicking on the 2D/3D button on the toolbar. You can also rotate your structure by clicking and dragging on it.
6. Calculate properties for your structure by clicking on the Properties button on the toolbar. This will open a window that shows various molecular descriptors, such as molecular weight, density, molar refractivity, etc.
7. Generate the IUPAC name for your structure by clicking on the Name button on the toolbar. This will open a window that shows the systematic name of your structure according to the IUPAC rules.
8. Draw additional structures or reactions by using the same steps as above. You can also copy and paste structures from other sources or import them from different file formats.
9. Create a report or presentation for your structures by clicking on the Report button on the toolbar. This will open a window that allows you to customize the layout and content of 8cf37b1e13
