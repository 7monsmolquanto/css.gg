Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport (IATA: SHA, ICAO: ZSSS) is one of two international airports of Shanghai and an important aviation hub of China. Hongqiao Airport mainly serves domestic and regional flights, with limited international flights. It is located near the town of Hongqiao in Changning District, 13 kilometres (8.1 mi) west of downtown, and is closer to the city center than Pudong Airport, Shanghai's main international airport. Hongqiao Airport is a hub for China Eastern Airlines, Shanghai Airlines, Juneyao Airlines and Spring Airlines. In 2016, Hongqiao Airport handled 40,460,135 passengers, making it the 7th busiest airport in China and the 45th busiest in the world. By the end of 2011 Hongqiao Airport hosted 22 airlines serving 82 scheduled passenger destinations.
 
The scenery covers both terminals of the airport, including the new Terminal 2 that opened in 2010. The terminal buildings are modeled with great attention to detail, both inside and outside. You can see the check-in counters, security checkpoints, boarding gates, baggage claim areas and even some shops and restaurants inside the terminals. The exterior of the buildings are also well textured and feature realistic glass effects and night illumination.
 
The apron and taxiway are also very detailed, with custom ground poly and realistic textures. You can see the markings, signs, lights and pavement cracks on the ground. The scenery also includes manually placed plants and volumetric grass around the airport to add some greenery and realism. The airport is also populated with animated trains (CHR) and vehicles that move around the airport realistically. The scenery also supports SODE jetways that can be activated by pressing Ctrl+J or using the SODE menu.
 
The scenery also features dynamic lights that enhance the night environment of the airport. You can see the runway lights, taxiway lights, apron lights and building lights that create a beautiful atmosphere at night. The dynamic lights also cast realistic shadows on the ground and on the aircraft.
 
The performance of the scenery is very good, considering the amount of detail and objects included. I tested it on FSX with medium-high settings and I got around 25-30 fps on average. The scenery also works well on P3D v4 and v5 with similar performance. The scenery is compatible with ORBX FTX Global Base Pack and FTX Global Vector.
 
The installation of the scenery is very easy and straightforward. You just need to run the installer file and enter your serial number that you get from simMarket when you purchase the product. The installer will automatically detect your FSX or P3D folder and install the scenery files there. You can also choose to install some optional features such as static aircrafts or low resolution textures if you want to save some disk space or improve performance.
 
The scenery comes with a PDF manual that explains the features of the scenery and how to use them. It also includes some screenshots of the airport and some charts for reference. The manual is in English and Chinese languages.
 
Overall, I think this is a very impressive scenery of Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport that offers a lot of detail and realism for FSX and P3D users. It is definitely worth checking out if you are interested in flying to or from this airport or if you just want to explore one of China's most modern airports.
