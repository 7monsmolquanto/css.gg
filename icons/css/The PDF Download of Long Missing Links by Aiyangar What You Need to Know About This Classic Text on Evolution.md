## What is Long Missing Links about?
 
Long Missing Links is one of Aiyangar's most famous and controversial books. It was published in 1927 by G.A. Natesan & Co., Madras. The book consists of four parts: Part I deals with the origin and development of Tamil language and literature; Part II deals with the origin and development of Sanskrit language and literature; Part III deals with the origin and development of Indian civilization; Part IV deals with the origin and development of Indian religion.
 
The main argument of the book is that there is a close connection between the Vedic and Dravidian civilizations, which have been separated by artificial barriers created by later invaders and colonizers. Aiyangar claims that both civilizations share a common ancestry, culture, religion, and philosophy, which can be traced back to the Harappan civilization. He also claims that both civilizations have influenced each other throughout history, resulting in a rich and diverse heritage that belongs to all Indians.
 
The book is based on extensive research and analysis of various sources, such as linguistic evidence, literary evidence, archaeological evidence, historical evidence, religious evidence, etc. Aiyangar cites hundreds of references from ancient texts, modern scholars, foreign travelers, etc. to support his claims. He also provides maps, charts, diagrams, illustrations, etc. to make his arguments more clear and convincing.
